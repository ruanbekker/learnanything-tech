## Jeff Geerling

As for many people "[geerlingguy](https://github.com/geerlingguy)" is no stranger, and for me personally a superhero, as I've learned so much from him.

In this section [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/) covers his [Ansible 101 Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN) which is absolutely gold when you want to go from zero to hero using Ansible.

### Introduction to Ansible

This is the first episode of Jeff Geerling's Ansible 101 Series and he walks us through how to install ansible, how to run tasks on remote servers and how to integrate [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to build local virtual machines and also covers how to write your first ansible playbook:
